# Community-Necessity-Research
This program will pull from many sources to get a closer look on what communities might be most in need of with hope to strengthen weaknesses.
Data to be extracted will be amoung job types, number of people with 401Ks, city transportation qualities, amount of free time(based on number of 9-5s), the scores and participation in clubs and athletics of individual schools and quality of their facilities, crime rates and the "crime of choice"(for example, the crime in IV would be bike thefts), in order to be better prepared for that crime in that area. Other sets of data could include the health and affordable ratings of food establishments, types of insurance deals given to the bulk of people in respected communities, number of parks, healthcare needs...
The hope is for this data to be publicized to raise aqareness of each community's unique needs so others, maybe even people in our community, can use this info to pinpoint problems and come up with specialized solutions.
